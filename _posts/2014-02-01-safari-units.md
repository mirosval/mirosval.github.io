Did you know that there are still people in this world who use imperial units?
For some reason they refuse to switch and continue using this stupid system.
I requent Reddit and it's quite common to find these people there, so instead
of just bitching I decided to do something about it.

I have made this Safari Extension [Units](https://github.com/mirosval/Units-Safari-Extension),
[Download](https://github.com/mirosval/Units-Safari-Extension/blob/master/units.safariextz?raw=true)

It takes common expressions as `He is 5'4" tall` and translates them to `He is 5'4" (162.56 cm) tall`,
so now you know that *he* is quite short.

It can also convert some other units, such as miles to km, mpg to km/l and lbs to kg. Of course it
does have limitations, for example if somebody writes `He is 6 feet tall` or `He is 200` it does not 
get translated, maybe I'll add it later, or if somebody wants to contribute, you're more than
welcome.

I've switched from Safari back to Chrome recently, so might be I port it there as well,
when I get sufficiently annoyed again.
